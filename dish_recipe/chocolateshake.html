        Chocolate Milkshake is our most favorite variety of milkshake,
        hands down. This beverage in general, is more popular in the 
        west, especially in USA, where a meal of burger and fries is
        never complete without a milkshake. But in the past few years,
        this milk-based beverage has become quite common in the Indian
        food scene too. The Chocolate Milkshake Recipe remains the
        quintessential choice for kids and adults alike. In this post,
        I have shared a super easy, quick and yummy way of making
        this milkshake with cocoa powder.
